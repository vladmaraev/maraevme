	abstract = {Laughter and gaze have an important role in managing and coordi-nating social interactions. In the current work, using a multimodal corpus of dyadic taste-testing interactions, we explore whether laughs performing different pragmatic functions are accompanied by different gaze patterns towards the interlocutor, both from the point of view of the laughing participant and from her partner. We also investigate the role of gaze in laughter coordination between interactants. Our results show that laughs performing different pragmatic functions are related to different gaze patterns, both for the laugher and her partner, and that gaze is an important cue exploited by interactants when reciprocating laughter or laughing simultaneously. We discuss our data in relation to the literature about laughter and gaze functions in interaction, linking them to dialogic context. Our results stress the importance of laughter and gaze for modeling of multimodal meaning construction and coordination in interaction, and are therefore relevant for researchers designing human-like embodied conversational agents. },

Our work is crucially grounded on the assumption that para- and non-verbal behaviour are not simply redundant to the linguistic content conveyed, but themselves contribute meaning and affect the unfolding dialogue. We address the following questions: (1) Do laughs with different pragmatic functions relate to different patterns of gaze? (2) Does gaze towards a partner play a significant role in laughter coordination and alignment?},

	ABSTRACT = {In this paper we treat humorous situations as a series of events underpinned by topoi, principles of reasoning recognised within a socio-cultural community. We claim that humorous effect in jokes and other discourse is often created by the juxtaposition of topoi evoked. A prerequisite for this is that there is a shift where the interpreter of the discourse updates their information state with regard to a second topos being evoked. This view of humour is consistent with an incremental analysis of dialogue, and we therefore argue that interaction is central both for humour creation and interpretation. We point out some different ways in which topoi are juxtaposed in humorous dialogues as well as in jokes published in social media or in joke books, and take jokes from the coronavirus pandemic as an example because this makes lots of new topoi available and therefore offers the opportunity of creating novel jokes based on the juxtaposition of the new and existing topoi. We explore how the mechanisms of inference in dialogue can be applied to humour through the four elements from our title: old (existing), new (not previously existing), borrowed (associated with a different situation) and taboo (inappropriate in the context).}
